# Anime Guide

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), with [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) used for backend and authentication.

## About this app

This app is designed to do two basic things:
- Allow users to create reviews of animes, either extremely quick and simple ones or very detailed ones
- Allow users to group animes into playlist-like "guides" in order to make sharing multiple recommendations with friends easier

Currently, all functionality is pretty much complete. Users can create accounts, CRUD guides, CRUD reviews, and search for animes, guides, and other users. Now we're just working on a homepage, debugging, and finishing touches.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

`bun run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
